# The number of designs to generate.  On most computing clusters, this can be set to a high
# number, and jobs can be permitted to end when their time limit is reached:
-nstruct 1000
 
# Parameters adjusting the automatic setup of bonds to metal atoms:
-metals_distance_constraint_multiplier 5.0
-metals_angle_constraint_multiplier 5.0
-auto_setup_metals
 
# The input PDB file (interpreted as an all-atom representation):
-in:file:s inputs/4EXS_Dcys_Lpro.pdb
-in:file:fullatom
 
# Since glycine Ramachandran tables used for scoring are based on statistics from the Protein
# Data Bank, they are biased towards glycine residues in positive-phi regions of Ramachandran
# space.  When designing with D-amino acids, the following correction should always be
# applied:
-symmetric_gly_tables true
 
# Bonds between all covalently-connected atoms will be written to the output PDB file, to aid
# visualization in PyMol:
-write_all_connect_info
 
# The input RosettaScripts XML file:
-parser:protocol xml/NDM1i_1_design.xml
 
# Since some jobs are expected to fail due to filters that donâ€™t pass, we do not want the
# executable to exit with failure status if there are some failures:
-jd2:failed_job_exception false
 
# The following line should be uncommented for production runs, to prevent writing of a large
# output log:
#-mute all
