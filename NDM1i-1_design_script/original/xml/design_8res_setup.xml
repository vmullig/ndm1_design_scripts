        # This script takes as input PDB structure 4EXS in which the L-captopril has been
        # converted to a D-cysteine, L-proline dipeptide stub.  It then extends this stub,
        # prepending three glycine residues and appending three glycine residues.  Finally, it
        # sets the omega torsion angles of all of these residues to 180 degrees.
        # 
        # This script was tested against Rosetta weekly release 2016.46 (Git SHA1
        # 47669d9d2e9f659f4889dc89ee6305575dd87c2e).  It is NOT RECOMMENDED if the newer
        # scripts for Rosetta 3.13 can be used instead, and is provided ONLY for scientific
        # reproducibility!
