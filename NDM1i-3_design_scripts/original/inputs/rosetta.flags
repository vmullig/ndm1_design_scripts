# On most clusters with queueing systems, it is simplest to set the number of output
# structures to a large number and to allow Rosetta to write structures until the job times
# out: 
-nstruct 1000
 
# The input RosettaScripts XML file:
-parser:protocol xml/NDM1i_3_design_legacy.xml
 
# The input PDB file (interpreted as an all-atom representation):
-in:file:s inputs/Moriarty_xtal_chainB_pep_opened.pdb
-in:file:fullatom
 
# Output PDB files should include CONECT records for all bonds to aid visualization:
-write_all_connect_info
 
# Since glycine Ramachandran tables used for scoring are based on statistics from the Protein
# Data Bank, they are biased towards glycine residues in positive-phi regions of Ramachandran
# space.  When designing with D-amino acids, the following correction should always be
# applied:
-symmetric_gly_tables true
 
# Since some jobs are expected to fail due to filters that donâ€™t pass, we do not want the
# executable to exit with failure status if there are some failures:
-jd2:failed_job_exception false
 
# The following line should be uncommented for production runs, to prevent writing of a large
# output log:
#-mute all
